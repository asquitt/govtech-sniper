# Capability Integration Tracker

Purpose: make hidden/orphaned capabilities visible and track integration status across backend routes, frontend surfaces, tests, and live verification.

## Status Legend
- `Integrated`: wired in UI + API and verified in current workflows.
- `Partial`: implemented but not fully wired, discoverable, or validated end-to-end.
- `Hidden`: implemented but not visible in primary navigation or key workflows.
- `Orphaned`: code exists but currently lacks active integration path.
- `Planned`: identified target, implementation pending.

## Update Rules
- Update this file in every session where capabilities are tested or integrated.
- Add an entry when new hidden/orphaned code is discovered.
- Move items toward `Integrated` only after code + tests + live UI verification.
- Keep evidence concrete: route prefix, UI surface, test coverage, and date.

## Integration Backlog (Prioritized)
1. Add NAICS/set-aside cohort drilldowns on teaming partner trends.
2. Add websocket telemetry threshold alerts + export for operational audits.
3. Add in-product MFA challenge modal (replace prompt-style fallback) for export/share step-up retries.
